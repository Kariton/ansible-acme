  0.2.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - revoke_old_certificates role - allow to revoke by ACME account key instead
        of certificate private key by setting ``acme_certificate_revoke_with_acme_account``
        to ``true``. This allows to revoke certificates with BuyPass, which does not
        support revocation by certificate private key.
      release_summary: Feature and repository maintenance release.
